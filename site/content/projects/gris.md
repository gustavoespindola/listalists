description: >-
  'Gris' is a low-tech greywater-system for Third World Countries which can
  collect all the water you use during a shower. You can use this collected grey
  water for flushing the toilet, cleaning the house and for certain washing
  activities. This way you can save at least 80 liter water/person/day in an
  average household which means at least 1.5 billion liter saved water per day
  in such an 50 million habitant country like Colombia.
