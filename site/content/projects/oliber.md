  ## The best quality


  Oliber is made by simple materials like neoprene, that is a breathable fabric,
  is soft and won’t generate rubbing on the skin. It has 2 magnets that can hold
  up to 1 kg. and velcro which makes it very adaptable, better attachment to the
  stump and is easy to put on.


  Oliber is an orthotics for people with atrophied hands such as amputees, hand
  in cocoon, arthritis or osteoarthritis, which seeks to  provide autonomy when
  performing daily activities.
