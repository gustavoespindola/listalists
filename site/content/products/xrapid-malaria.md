description: >-
  Using a system of pattern recognition, xRapid-Malaria can diagnose malaria
  from thick or thin blood slides at the touch of a button. Our technology
  streamlines the diagnostic process by providing an accessible solution for
  health workers in the lab and in the field.


  xRapid-Malaria is an innovation that sidesteps the issues with currently
  available methods. It can be stored anywhere, taken anywhere with very little
  training required.


  The retention of information that smartphone technology allows makes for a
  powerful disease-mapping tool that can contribute towards predicting future
  outbreaks.
