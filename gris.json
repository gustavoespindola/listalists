You can use this collected grey water for flushing the toilet, cleaning the house and for certain washing activities. This way you can save at least 80 liter water/person/day in an average household which means at least 1.5 billion liter saved water per day in such an 50 million habitant country like Colombia.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"site/content/projects/gris.md","sha":"2a366a75aa340de6f2f99dfc4e26d40e40794056"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2017-08-04T12:34:05.155Z"}
